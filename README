This code allow you to get memory usage of mpi process and the daemon.
The info come from /proc/pid/status(VmRss VmSize, etc)  & /proc/pid/smaps(Rss & Pss)

#Build
    $ gcc be_true.c memory.c -o be_true
    $ mpicc check_memory.c memory.c -o check_memory

#Usage
    $ ./be_true -l 1
    $ mpirun -np 4 ./check_memory -l level_value

    There are 3 level of information you can print,
    -l 1,2,3 allow to print different level of information from /proc/pid/status

    level 1 (necessary: both mpi process and daemon)
    long VmSize;
    long VmRss;
    int Pss;

    level 2 (important: ompi process only,  level 1 is included)
    long VmPin;
    long RssShmem;
    long RssFile;
    long RssAnon;

    level 3 (extention: ompi process only, level 1 & 2 are included)
    long VmData;
    long VmStk;
    long VmExe;
    long VmLib;
    long VmPTE;
    long VmPMD;
    long VmSwap;
    char Cpus_allowed[256];
    char Cpus_allowed_list[256];
    char Mems_allowed[256];
    char Mems_allowed_list[256];

#processing test results
Run process.py can process results, include statistis calculation of mean / std, also detect outier
(1) Data saved in memory_info.csv by sbatch_slurm.sh
    Table columns are:
    echo "Rank,VmRSS(status),VmSize,Rss(smaps),Pss,Ppid,pVmRSS(status),pVmSize,pRss(smaps),pPss" >> memory_info.csv
(2)Also generate scatter/boxplot figures for mpi_process_pss, daemon_pss.

PSS – This is the most valuable column. It adds together the unique memory (USS)
and a proportion of shared memory derived by dividing total shared memory by the
number of other processes sharing that memory. Thus it will give you an accurate
representation of how much actual physical memory is being used per process, with
shared memory truly represented as shared. Think of it as physical memory.

RSS – Resident Set Size, which is the amount of shared memory plus unshared memory
used by each process. If any processes share memory, this will overreport the amount
of memory actually used, because the same shared memory will be counted more than once,
appearing again in each other process that shares the same memory. Thus it is an unreliable
number, especially when high-memory processes have a lot of forks.
